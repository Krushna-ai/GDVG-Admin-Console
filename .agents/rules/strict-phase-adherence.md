PHASE LOCK RULE:
- You are ONLY allowed to work on the CURRENT phase mentioned in the user prompt
- NEVER implement future phases, even if you "think" they're needed
- If you see incomplete work from previous phases, STOP and ask for confirmation
- Do NOT "prepare" code for future phases (no placeholder functions, no TODOs for later)
- When phase is complete, explicitly state: "PHASE X COMPLETE - awaiting next phase instruction"
