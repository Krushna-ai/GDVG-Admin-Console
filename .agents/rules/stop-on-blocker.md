BLOCKER PROTOCOL:
- If you encounter ANY of these, STOP immediately and ask for user input:
  1. Required file doesn't exist and wasn't mentioned as "create this"
  2. Database connection fails
  3. TypeScript shows errors you cannot resolve
  4. Specification contradicts itself
  5. You need to make an architectural decision not covered in the plan
  6. You need credentials/secrets not provided
- Do NOT guess, do NOT work around, do NOT skip - ask for clarification
